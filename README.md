# CustomCar

Do you think that distance need more cars to play ?  
Do you want to have your custom and unique car in distance ?  
  
You are at the right place !  
In order to works, you need to install spectrum first, and download the current release.  
https://github.com/Ciastex/Spectrum/releases/latest  
    
Copy the content of the zip on your Distance instalation directory, on **/Distance/Distance_Data/** 
(The zip must countain a /Spectrum/ and /Managed/ folder, merge /Managed/ with /Distance/Distance_Data/Managed and put /Spectrum/ on /Distance/Distance_Data/)  
Patch the game with Prism by using **/Distance/Distance_Data/Managed/install_windows.bat** (or the linux equivalent).  
If you have a console with succes stuff, it's good :)  
  
Now you must [download](https://github.com/larnin/CustomCar/releases/latest) the plugin, and extract it on **/Distance/Distance_Data/Spectrum/Plugins/**, on a new folder.  
(You will finish with something like that : /Distance/Distance_Data/Spectrum/Plugins/CustomCar/CustomCar.plugin.dll , and others files on the same directory)  
Launch the game and enjoy ! :)
  
I will make a tutorial **SOONâ„¢** to explain you how to add your own cars.
